## Testing Your Alexa Skill

So far, we have [created a Voice User Interface](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/blob/master/handling-responses/dialog-directive-delegate/step-by-step/1-voice-user-interface.md) and [a Lambda function](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/blob/master/handling-responses/dialog-directive-delegate/step-by-step/2-lambda-function.md), and [connected the two together](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/blob/master/handling-responses/dialog-directive-delegate/step-by-step/3-connect-vui-to-lambda.md).  Your skill is now ready to test.

1.  **Go back to the [Amazon Developer Portal](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skills/list) and select your skill from the list.** You may still have a browser tab open if you started at the beginning of this tutorial.

2.  **Open the "Test" tab on the left side.**

3.  **Test with a device.** For the skill builder beta, test dialog delegation using a device. For this sample say, "Alexa open Plan a Trip" then respond to the prompts as Alexa asks for toCity, fromCity, and travelDate. Also try some of the utterances we added to enabling over answering to see that in action. [See Dialog Interface Reference](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/dialog-interface-reference).
4. **See the full documentation for more details** The [Using the skill builder (beta) ](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/ask-define-the-vui-with-gui) walks you through creating intents, slots, and dialogs. The [dialog interface reference](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/dialog-interface-reference) will give you more details on the Delegate directive used in this sample as well as the ElicitSlot, ConfirmSlot, ConfirmIntent directives.
